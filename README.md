Abstract/Problem statement:- Doctoring of documents have been quite common these days. I Proposed a method to verify fake documents using cryptography techniques and designed and modified original SHA-1 algorithm to make it collision free and harder to Brute Force.


## Instructions

#### I've Attached a pdf file which contains documentation and the code for the testing and hashing algorithm.

#### This was my 1st Project. So there can be mistakes and i've also tested this algorithm it works like a charm.
