Abstract/Problem statement:- Doctoring of documents have been quite common these days. I Proposed a method to verify fake documents using cryptography techniques and designed and modified original SHA-1 algorithm to make it collision free and harder to Brute Force.


## Instructions

I've Attached a pdf file which contains documentation and the code for the testing and hashing algorithm.

This was my 1st Project. So there can be mistakes and i've also tested this algorithm it works like a charm.
